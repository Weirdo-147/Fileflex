## ⚙️ Steps to Set Up Locally  

### Prerequisites  
- Install **Node.js** (for React)  
- Install **Python 3.x** (for Django)  
- Install **PostgreSQL** (if running locally, as Supabase uses PostgreSQL)  

### Backend Setup (Django)  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fileflex.git  
   cd fileflex/fileflex_backend  
   ```  
2. Install Python dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Set up environment variables:  
   Create a `.env` file and add the required keys (e.g., Supabase credentials, secret keys).  
4. Run database migrations:  
   ```bash  
   python manage.py migrate  
   ```  
5. Start the backend server:  
   ```bash  
   python manage.py runserver  
   ```  

### Frontend Setup (React)  
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:  
   ```bash  
   cd ../frontend  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  
3. Start the React development server:  
   ```bash  
   npm start  
   ```  

### View the Application  
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:8000` for the backend.
